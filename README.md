# bimmer_connected
This is a simple library to query the status of your BMW from the connected drive portal.

See demo.py for usage.

I wrote this as I want to include it in Home Assistant.

# Compatibility
So far it is only tested with one vehicle with a "NBTEvo" navigation system. 
If you have any trouble with other navigation systems, please create an issue.

Also: If you need additional attributes parsed from the anser from the server, 
please create and issue.


# Thank you
